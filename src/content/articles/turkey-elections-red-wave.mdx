# Turkey Elections: Red Wave Conquers Anatolia

"Today, Bursa has written history. Exactly 47 years later, the Republican People's Party came to power in Bursa." excitedly say Republican People's Party (CHP) leader of Bursa after the results of a dazzling local elections of Turkey.

Results came as a shock to most of the opposition, since the some cities which counted as conservative and "AKP stronghold" drastically selected secular CHP in mayoral elections. Cities such as Bursa, Amasya and Adıyaman, which selected conservative candidates for decades, changed their mind and voted for candidates of parties other than AKP.

Turkey's local elections of 2019 and 2024 have unveiled a dramatic shift in the political landscape. The outcomes of these elections not only reflect changing voter sentiments but also indicate potential new trajectories for the nation's future political and governance models.

The most striking change observed in the election outcomes is the rise of the Republican People's Party (CHP) in urban centers. The CHP's increased control over metropolitan municipalities, notably in Turkey's major cities, signals a growing discontent among urban populations with the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP).

This shift is particularly noteworthy given Turkey's traditionally polarized political environment, where major cities play a pivotal role in setting political trends and narratives.

#### Stressful Results for AKP

While the AKP saw a slight reduction in its hold over metropolitan municipalities, it has managed to maintain a substantial presence in districts and towns. This indicates a nuanced voter base that, while showing signs of exploring alternatives, remains loyal in certain locales.

Such dynamics suggest that the AKP's historical stronghold may be diversifying, requiring the party to adjust its strategies to address evolving voter preferences and concerns at both the local and national levels.

Also, current worrying situation of Turkey's economy, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and AKP's actions regarding situation in Gaza, and monetary problems of retired population seemed to had an impact on the results. Specifically the trading actions of the government with Israel seemed to affect voters, some blaming this behavior as "hypocricy".

#### The Emergence of New Players

Another noteworthy development is the emergence of new political forces, such as the YRP (New Welfare Party), which highlights a vibrant political landscape where voters are increasingly open to alternatives. YRP's approach of Israel/Gaza war seemed to influence conservative voters and managed to get their votes.
